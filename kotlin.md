# Overview

This is a small project. This is a body management made by Kotlin.

This program is to set goals for those poeple who do not have their ideal weight. I use Body mass index (BMI) as my measurement. The most ideal BMI is 22. If 18 < BMI <26, the person can be considered as a healthy person. If BMI < 18 or BMI > 26, The program will make monthly goals for 12 months. If BMI > 34, the program will make monthly goals for 18 months.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
